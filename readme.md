#Rock, Paper, Scissors V2

##Thoughts before jumping in:

This is a project that at the same time makes me feel excited and a little bit anxious, I feel like DOM manipulation is one of my weakest suits overall, and if you add the game logic to that, I can see things compounding in an unfavorable way kind of quckly.

However, a big challenge is always, of course, an opportunity for learning, so that's a thing that I'm excited for. I know I'm not gonna be a DOM master from this project, but it's a good thing to find a challenge.

I did do some groundwork for this one though, which is not a thing I really do a lot --that's a bad habit-- writing out some pseudocode related to the handling of DOM things.

I don't really like to do this, but I'm starting off with a copy of the previous file; if it were up to me, I would start from the ground up, but refactoring is another skill I have to develop.
