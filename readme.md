Rock, paper, scissors project:

Expectations going in:
	
	I expect this project to be relatively simple in that 
	making a bot that selects an option out of three isn't a 
	herculean task, however, I expect the logic of the game itself
	to be the biggest obstacle, since I want to try and find the
	most elegant way to handle the logic but I have no idea
	what that even looks like!

	The main idea that I have right now about how to make the 
	game logic work is with either a series of if blocks or 
	"?" logic operators that firstly determine the data inputted
	from the player and from that point, check for the data the
	"ai" chose, determining if the player won or lost.
