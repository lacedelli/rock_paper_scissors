# Rock, Paper, Scissors V2

## Thoughts before jumping in:

This is a project that at the same time makes me feel excited and a little bit anxious, I feel like DOM manipulation is one of my weakest suits overall, and if you add the game logic to that, I can see things compounding in an unfavorable way kind of quckly.

However, a big challenge is always, of course, an opportunity for learning, so that's a thing that I'm excited for. I know I'm not gonna be a DOM master from this project, but it's a good thing to find a challenge.

I did do some groundwork for this one though, which is not a thing I really do a lot --that's a bad habit-- writing out some pseudocode related to the handling of DOM things.

I don't really like to do this, but I'm starting off with a copy of the previous file; if it were up to me, I would start from the ground up, but refactoring is another skill I have to develop.

## Thoughts after finishing the project

So, confession time: I had to scale down the size of this project from what I originally wanted to do, I'm talking svg icons for the options, custom animations that disabled the other options and centered the player's choice, in my mind, it looked nothing like the end product.

Which isn't to say that I think the end product is bad, I'm genuinely kinda proud that it works, since I expected it to give me a lot more trouble than it did. Mind you. it isn't that the project went swimmingly; for starters I had to re-structure a lot of the game, the main core is gone, it was replaced by the event listener running each round of the game when the player selects one of the possible answers.

Now that I'm talking about that, I guess that I have to explain why I made an anonymous function just to call playRound, to be honest, the reason why that is, is because I don't really know how to call functions with parameters in that manner still, I still have a lot to learn regarding functional programming and higher level functions, but honestly, I feel like I'm just one breakthroug away from completely understanding it.

Barebones, not really what I had in mind when I started, and all the layout work in CSS is honestly trash, but it works. And that's where I'm at right now.
